# Resolver: Named Instances

## Why name a registration?

Because named registrations and resolutions let you change the behavior of the app.

## Example: Named Value Types

You can register value types and parameters for later resolution. However, since Resolver registers object by type, the only way to tell one String from another String is to name it.

```swift
register(name: "appKey") { "12345" }
register { XYZSessionService(key: resolve(name: "appKey")) }
```

The first line registers a String named `appKey`.

The factory in the second line resolves a String parameter named `appKey`, and passes it to the `XYZSessionService` initialization function.

This is a good way to get authentication keys, application keys, and other values to the objects that need them.

## Example: Mocking Data

Consider the following set of registrations.

```swift
register { resolve(name: Bundle.main.infoDictionary!["mode"] as! String) as XYZServicing }
register(name: "data") { XYXService() as XYZServicing }
register(name: "mock") { XYXMockService() as XYZServicing }
```

We've registered XYZServicing three times, one without a name, one with the name "data", and the other with the name "mock".

The nameless registration, however, gets a string from the app's info.plist and asks Resolver to resolve an instance with the proper type and with the proper name.

Let's see it in use by a client.

```swift
let service: XYZServicing = resolver.resolve()
```

The client just asks Resolver for a service.

Behind the scenes, however, and depending upon how the app is compiled and the "mode" value is set in the app's plist, one build will get actual data, while the other build will get mock data.

And as long as XYXMockService complies with the XYZServicing protocol, the client doesn't care.

Nor should it.

## Example: Changing Behavior

Now, consider the next pair of registrations:

```swift
register(name: "add") { XYZViewModelAdding() as XYZViewModelProtocol }
register(name: "edit") { XYZViewModelEditing() as XYZViewModelProtocol }
```

Here we're registering two instances of the same protocol, `XYZViewModelProtocol`.

But one view model appears to be specific to adding things, while the other's behavior leans more towards editing.

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController, Resolving {
    var editMode: Bool = true // set, perhaps, by calling segue
    lazy var viewModel: XYZViewModelProtocol = resolver.resolve(name: editMode ? "edit" : "add")!
}
```

Now the view controller gets the proper view model for the job. The `lazy var` ensures that the viewModel resolution doesn't occur until after the viewController is instantiated and `prepareForSegue` has had a chance to correctly set `editMode`.
